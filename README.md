Summary and Reflection
This project is my attempt to recreate the Google Homepage. Some of the features include the effects when hovering over the elements, be it a border or underline.

I faced more problems than I expected creating this web page. Until now I'm not sure what I did that DIDN'T work the last time and how exactly I solved it. The ones I still cant figure out was how to separate my list elements in the header and footer and putting it on opposite ends. I made them separate lists and implemened margin right and left but it didn't seem to work. In the end I set my nav bar/footer display to flex and implemented space-between to separate them.

What I learnt
- centering elements on the page with margin: auto
- using overflow:hidden on body to stop the scrollbar from appearing
- setting margin: 0 to ensure no whitespace on the left of the navbar
- the use of flex to move elements around in a container
- creating a nav bar and footer using <ul> and display: inline

As for what I still need to learn, the list includes: the measurements I can use for height and width(not just using px), types of display and when to use them.

However, as for the improvements I'd like to see in the future, they include being responsive, centering that grid symbol on the top left,
and generally having cleaner code.
