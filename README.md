Introduction:
As part of The Odin Project, I have to create a Google Webpage

General outline:
1. Create the search bar
- centered search bar
- round border radius
- insert magnifying glass image/icon into search bar and position at the start
- insert microphone image and position at the end

2. Insert google image and position it above the search bar

3. Insert 2 boxes, colour grey, with texts "google search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky"
